# Quest 4: Royal Smith's Puzzle

## Part I

One of the grand tournament's most time-honoured traditions is the Master of the Royal Forge challenge. Knights proceed to the colossal forge, where the song of steel echoes from afar. The King's Smith awaits, silently gesturing towards a section of the courtyard where wooden logs have been meticulously arranged. **Massive nails**, with heads the size of a human hand, are embedded in the logs. Next to each log lies a hammer. Each contender stands by one.

The blacksmith explains the rules of the first round. Several nails have been driven into the top of the log, each protruding at a **different height**. You must drive the nails into the logs so that their heads **form a perfectly straight line**.

You begin hammering, but it's hard to tell if the nail has moved even a fraction. It seems this will be a test of endurance... To pass the time, you note the **length each nail** protrudes. It turns out that they are precisely measured, each expressed in whole units. Additionally, you notice that each nail head has a small black dot in the center. Examining your hammer closely, you find a similar dot on its head. You take a swing, aiming to align the dots upon impact. The nail drives into the log **exactly one unit deeper with each strike**! It's not about endurance, but precision and accuracy! The blacksmith glances your way and smiles knowingly. You know the length of all the nails (`your notes`), so you can calculate **how many strikes at minimum** it will take to align them all perfectly.

### Example based on the following notes:

```
3
4
7
8
```

The lengths of the nails are 3, 4, 7, and 8 units. The shortest nail is 3 units, and the rest must be levelled to this height.
It takes **1 strike** to drive the 4-unit nail to 3 units; **4 strikes** to bring the 7-unit nail down to 3 units; and **5 strikes** to do the same for the 8-unit nail.

In total, you need **10 strikes** of the hammer.

*What is the minimum number of hammer strikes needed to level all the nails?*
